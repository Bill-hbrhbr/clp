# Dependency Taskfiles

Follow the guidelines below when writing and updating dependency installation taskfiles.

- Use `deps:utils:install-remote-cmake-lib` and thus `yscope-dev-utils:cmake:install-remote-tar`
  whenever it applies. For respective task of other libraries/components:
  - Include `deps:utils:init` in the `deps:` section of the task.
  - Explain why we aren't installing it if it is a CMake project that's installable.
  - Ensure that they have proper checksum mechanisms to check if they are up-to-date.
  - Use `<lib>-extracted` as the folder name for the contents extracted from the downloaded tarball.

- Avoid parsing the version number from the download URL unless it is needed elsewhere. Since URL
  formats can change over time, itâ€™s more maintainable to use the full URL directly as plain text.

## CMake Generate Arguments

The following guidelines apply to flags in the `CMAKE_GEN_ARGS` section of tasks that call
`deps:utils:install-remote-cmake-lib`:

- Set `CMP0074` to `NEW` in `CMAKE_GEN_ARGS` whenever:
  - The component's minimum required CMake version is less than 3.27 (where CMP0074 defaults to OLD)
  - The component depends on another via `<lib_name>_ROOT`.

- Attempt to build both shared and static libraries for each dependency.

- Avoid building unit tests, examples, docs or binaries that are unused to speed up the install
  process.

- Choose to turn off lib-specific build testing flag instead of `BUILD_TESTING` if possible.

- Set `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` to `Release` if another build type is not strictly required.

- Set `CMAKE_INSTALL_MESSAGE` to `LAZY` to avoid clobbering of the log screen.

- Do not include flags that are no-op, including the ones that merely set variables to their
  default values found in `CMakeLists.txt` and other cmake files used to generate `CMakeCache.txt`.
